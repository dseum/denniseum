It’s nearing the end of my first college semester, and I have never been as hesitant about my future.

Writing my applications for higher-level education entailed a deep dive into my eighteen years alive, and by the winter of my senior year, I was convinced that I wanted to do something to change computation. I would devote myself to such a product, ultimately creating the tools that I envisioned all of society depending on. In light of that vision, I believed that broadening and specifying my knowledge of mathematics, computer science, and society would be the key to success. Indeed, I stacked my first semester with courses that, for my mental faculty, would stretch me beyond, more than I had ever tried to comprehend within any given four months in my life.

But what was the goal of such challenge?

I reached a point this semester, so overwhelmed by the sheer variety of academic concepts, lifestyle changes, and new people that I encountered. If I concentrated my entirety to achieve a complete understanding of the ideas I explored in class, I found anxiety in that I was missing out in the social joys and connections of college. If I tried to meet more students and develop existing relationships, I would no longer be able to concern myself with keeping my dormitory livable. If I reversed the entropy of my college environment, I would fall behind on my assignments.

I was constantly in a state of desperation, and amidst the self-imposed chaos, I found myself unable to sleep one night. I was frustrated at my inability to balance a life that I had deemed necessary to my dreams. Everything felt meaningless. I didn’t know what I was doing in college and why I was here.

What I really want to do is express my creativity and code something for myself. I want to apply the mathematics I learned to a project that could be the stepping stone into my dreams. And I remembered this special emotion that I had felt before, and it was such a nice feeling. It gave hope. Waking up the next morning, however, and realizing that the second semester was already approaching, the college anxiety pained me again. I kept hearing how the other people were going to be doing the most challenging courses the next semester, a level up. Albeit, they were truly passionate, but there was no way that reaching the maximum challenge was not a significant factor in all of our future course selections. After all, if one person was doing some course, everyone wanted to so that we would not fall behind. Additionally, with more and more friends planning to join certain courses, the fear of being left out was a considerable input.

Rather than an open learning opportunity, to me, college now seemed like the rapids, where nature and the laws of physics had decided a single path for all students. Every time you tried to step out and see what was beyond the fearsome churning of the water, you’d already be swept away, forcing you to first deal with the immediate burdens. It would be that constant cycle of being drawn back into the charted course of taking all the intense courses, ending up with a degree that you had worked hard for. But the more I thought about that future in four years, there would be no chance to dream and explore those dreams.

Where is the innovation in current society? It’s all boring nowadays, I thought. In reality, it’s because the rapids are even more rapid than before. Somehow, I need to change.
