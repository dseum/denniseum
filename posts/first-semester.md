It’s finally over! No matter how much I loved the novelty of college, these last few weeks emphasized that college is, unsurprisingly, centered on academics. With some of the worst grades received in my life even while feeling socially deprived, I am not completely sure how to move on. I’ve learned, however, some crucial details of productivity, applying to every aspect of my life.

First, I need to prepare for courses beforehand. Doing the bare minimum of attending lectures and completing homework results in bare minimum level of understanding. But that doesn’t feel great at all, and it means I can’t think creatively about a concept’s implications, etc. By reviewing fundamental content during the university hiatus, I can approach problem solving with much more dexterity. That way, I feel more comfortable with the ideas and have a far more exciting experience in learning.

Second, I need to leave time for activities I truly want to do. Courses are great for the perspectives of professors and broader material covered. Passions, nevertheless, are why I am mostly interested in pursuing college education. If I didn’t have visions of future projects I wanted to create but did not have the current ability to make, I would genuinely not have considered getting a specific education. There would be no reason to. By throttling my time such that I can’t test out mini-projects and other desired tests, there is no meaning to anything I’m doing in college.

Third, I need people. I’ve met so many people, many amongst them my best friends, and while I appreciate the academics, the only real memories I have of my first semester are the personal ones with my friends. Knowledge causes me to feel a certain set of feelings, but memories evoke feelings inclusive to knowledge in addition to emotions as well. And these memories are what drive my creativity and, thus, my goals. The days I am constantly alone, only surrounded by knowledge and my inner thoughts, have been the most educative but depressing moments in my life. And the ultimate priority in life is emotional health.

I’ve definitely, overall, had a rough time with the time crunch my first semester. Surprisingly, I found myself seeking an even more challenging schedule my second semester, even though I know I’m guaranteed to get even worse grades. But I’ve learned so much through the entire experience, and I was drawn to construct my schedule, for the first time, of courses purely driven by my spontaneous interest. What do I want to do right now? This question will define my second semester, which is why I will not have regrets, no matter the material outcome. I will feel complete.
