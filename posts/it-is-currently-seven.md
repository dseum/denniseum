It’s currently seven in the morning, and I am awestruck at the pink- and indigo- layered sky that continues to rise in its whiter color when I look up. But while the sky seems hopeful, being on the second floor of our university library, I only see a dark industrial lane of buildings and cars when I look down. Myself, I am in the middle that splits these two worlds.

But right now, I can’t help but be drawn to the dark lower level where everything seems to be so close to my reality. I constantly am trying to convince myself that I am not stressing, that I love what I’m doing, and that I can survive this week of work. But when overwhelmed, my thoughts seem painfully deluded, because I can feel my eyelids weighing down on my bloated eyes. And that’s because even after I finish one assignment, spending hours comprehending and solving, there’s yet another I need to do. It’s an endless platter of work that sometimes I don’t truly understand why I’m doing, but I’m helplessly subscribed to the necessity to do this work.

Just like that in those dark lanes, cars line up in these continuous queues, with the people inside living their early life of working. We’re all trying to desperately work, and it sometimes drives you crazy. More than that, you feel dead, even though you want to live.

My hands are bluish-gray, or I’m seeing everything with a negated-color filter. My lungs have never been so steady, tiredly rising every two seconds. My legs fill with blood pulled from my brain.

I feel like everything is falling apart.

In this, I keep moving forward, however. Being with my friends gives an undetermined amount of powerful vitality that drives me into challenge recklessly. It’s the intimate conversations we have spending our entire life together. Ultimately, they give me the strength, and I’ve never valued them more than now, when I struggle to find myself. They define me for me — being with them at seven in the morning, no matter how painful for an individual, is what I learn to love as a group.
